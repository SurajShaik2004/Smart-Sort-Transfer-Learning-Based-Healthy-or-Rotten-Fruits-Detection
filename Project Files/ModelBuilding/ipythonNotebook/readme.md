<p>In this folder i am uploading the jupyter notebook which is when executed results in different models which can be saved by you and you can load them back for doing predictions</p>
This Trained model is then combined with the front end website with the help of backend flask ( The required code for this is present in the NutriGaze(smart Sort) folder you can check it.
when you execute this SmartSortModelCreation.ipynb file The Results are as follow ::
-> The raw dataset is pre processed and a new Output dataset is created.
-> This Output dataset is divided into Train ,Test and Validation dataset internally as a result of preprocessing.
-> This data set is ready for Training the model.
-> Many model in different Epochs are generated and saved when you execute this file.
-> This Generated models are used for Predictions.
-> Data visualization and model testing is also done in this file.

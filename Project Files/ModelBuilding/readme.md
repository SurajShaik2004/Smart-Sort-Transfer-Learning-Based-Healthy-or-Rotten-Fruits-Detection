LINK ::<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammad0subhan/fruit-and-vegetable-disease-healthy-vs-rotten" > DataSet </a><br>
This folder contains files and links To build my model for predicting Rotten Vs Fresh Fruits and vegitables this model is joined with the flask for building website<br>
when you execute this SmartSortModelCreation.ipynb file The Results are as follow ::<br>
-> The raw dataset is pre processed and a new Output dataset is created.<br>
-> This Output dataset is divided into Train ,Test and Validation dataset internally as a result of preprocessing.<br>
-> This data set is ready for Training the model.<br>
-> Many model in different Epochs are generated and saved when you execute this file.<br>
-> This Generated models are used for Predictions.<br>
-> Data visualization and model testing is also done in this file.<br>
